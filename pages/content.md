## Content Information
The content, which consists of 25 illustrations across 4 editions, in this collection varies so widely among each book and edition of Peter Pan. The differences extend from how Peter is portrayed himself as a character to whether or not there is color used in the illustrations. On the inside, they all tell the same tale of the boy who would never grow up. Their cover arts also vary in the sense that not all of them display any kind of characters but patterns rather. This page explores some of the content in this collection and how it all works together.

## Background Information
One of the copies in this collection is in the Public Domain because it is a republishing of the original copy of Peter Pan. All of the illustrations and images featured were part of the first edition that was published in 1911. Each one of these illustrations has this older look to them that adds to the mystery of the story and character of Peter Pan. The detail is immaculate considering the time period and they capture many of the characters and situations that appear within the book. It is interesting to have a piece of the original source material still exist and be able to bring into conversation with the other illustrations. Does this make these illustrations the original source material? What could this say about the other source materials?

## Other Books
The other books contain images scattered around the text more so which makes the images almost seem more secondary or just as if it was a flourish compared to the original 1911 copy. The images in the book published by Dorling Kindersley are much bigger but still are around the text or allow the text to remain as the focus. The Chiltern book tends to have more smaller pictures scattered around the text that seem to emphasize what is happening on the page specifically. These are vibrantly colored and incredibly beautiful. The Watermill sadly only has the two pictures of the cover as it contains no pictures on the inside. The portrayal of Peter Pan and the children differs from the other three in that he looks older than in the other two editions but not as old as in the Dorling Kindersley version.
