## Context
In what context this collection is viewed could vary from user to user. The common experience that they all have is that they are viewing illustrations from a wide variety of Peter Pan editions. Some of the users may be viewing it as pure enjoyment of images of Peter Pan while others will view it as a commentary on a greater story and illustrations within children's literature during the 20th century at large. 

Through more of an academic lense, the context of this collection is how the characters and story are perceived and understood by a variety of artists and illustrators. This could span from the 20th century to the 21st century since there are editions featured across both centuries. There is a great deal to explore since there are images featured from the original edition of Peter Pan which implies that the illustrator and author would have time to discuss it together. That enriches the context for that specific edition that much more. The other editions contain other illustrator which would paint the context in which they created the images much differently. Through the context of this entire collection, these aspects should be discussed and considered in an academic context.
