## About the Collection

Within this collection, users will be able to view 25 Peter Pan illustrations from 4 different copies of the book published by Watermill Press,Chiltern Publishing, and Suzeteo Enterprises. These vary from republishings of the novel to more children's books. Using Collection Builder, the user may look at each of these images and explore each one in greath depth. All of these images are books that I personally own and have enjoyed owning. Many of them were gifts to me that I now think could be a gift to the academic world. Their portrayals of Peter Pan and the characters within the story are all quite diverse in their own ways which merits an exploration of them.

This collection is primarily for those interested in exploring how different individuals perceive Peter Pan and how that is displayed in illustrations for the story. This extends to the characters in the book so that they too can be explored based upon how they are portrayed. Anyone who is interested in juvenile literature, particularly the artwork associated with it, will find this very interesting. Many of these pictures are from the 20th century so people interested in children's literature artwork from that era will find this incredibly interesting. Anyone who is a casual enjoyer of Peter Pan and similar stories may find this just as interesting in a recreational way while scholars of artwork, children's literature or artwork in children's literature may find this helpful to the research that they are looking to conduct.
